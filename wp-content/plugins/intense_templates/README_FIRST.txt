The files within this folder are a copy of the default templates used by Intense for several of the shortcodes. If you wish to change the layout of these shortcodes, you can copy this directory to your theme directory or your child theme directory. After copying, you should have a directory called intense_templates that is a mirror of this directory. Alter the copied templates as desired. See the documentation for further details.
